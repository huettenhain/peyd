# PEyD

The main part of this project is [peyd.txt](peyd.txt), which contains a slightly cleaned collection
of **PEiD** signatures gathered from all over the web. They are still outdated and 
unmaintained, but currently the best you can get if you want it scriptable. The python 
script itself takes filenames as arguments and will spit out the matching rules for them.
It is quite straightforward.
